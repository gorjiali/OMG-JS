# JS

* __Primitive value and non-primitive value__: All we mean by primitive is that it is like literally written as an actual value (```number```, ```string```, ```boolean```, ```null```, ```undefined```) rather than non-primitive that is a collection of values (```array```, ```object```).

* __Binary and unary operator__: Those kinds of operators, ones that has a left and a right in terms of their operands are called binary operators and unary operator means a single operand involved in the operation.
